My first game practices in JS

These are codes when I was learning JS on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a>

<ul>
<li>ChooseYourAdventure : You'll have a basic story line, have the user make some choices, and have a happy ending</li>
<li>RockPaperScissor: It's the famous taditional game, which can be written by function and if/else condition</li>
<li>Search Name: This is very simple search method for finding a string inside of another string</li>
<li>Dragon Slyer: In this game, you’ll battle a dragon. It will take 4 hits to slay the dragon, and if you miss even one hit, the dragon will defeat you!</li>
<li>ChooseYourAdventure2: much richer "choose your own adventure" game.</li>
<li>Contact list: I combine my knowledge of objects and arrays to create a simple contact list. Then, using functions, I am able to log the entries in our contact list to the console, as well as search for a particular entry.</li>
<li>Address book: I make a contact list of friends with name, phone number and email. I have list, search and add functions too.</li>
</ul>
